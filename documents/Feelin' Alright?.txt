"Feelin' Alright?", also known as "Feeling Alright", is a song written by Dave Mason of the English rock band Traffic for their eponymous 1968 album Traffic. It was also released as a single, and failed to chart on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100, but it did reach a bubbling under position of #123 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100. Joe Cocker performed a more popular rendition of the song on his 1969 album With a Little Help from My Friends, that did chart in the U.S. Both Traffic's and Cocker's versions appear in the 2012 movie Flight. The song was also featured in the 2000 film Duets, sung by Huey Lewis.


== Background ==
Dave Mason wrote "Feelin' Alright?" in Greece after leaving Traffic for the first time. He explained, "I think I had the words first. The funny thing is, people seem to think that it’s a fun sort of song, but it’s really about unrequited love. There’s a question mark in the title. It asks, 'Are you feeling all right?' 'Actually, I’m not feeling very good at all.'"
The song features a simple two-chord composition. Mason explained, "I had been playing sitar, so I wanted a certain sitar-like quality. It's not one chord, like a James Brown song, but it's close. The good thing was that I didn't need to do demos. Two chords I could remember."
Mason rejoined Traffic for their second album. During the recording, producer Jimmy Miller encouraged Mason and praised the song as "fantastic."

Joe Cocker recorded it to lead off his debut album With a Little Help from My Friends in 1969. He also amended the title of the original from "Feelin' Alright?" to "Feeling Alright". Released as a single in 1969, it reached #69 on the US singles chart, and #49 in Canada. In a 1972 re-release, it reached even higher to #33 on the same chart, and #35 in Canada. A live version was included in his double album Mad Dogs & Englishmen of 1970. Cocker performed a 'duet' of this song with John Belushi imitating Cocker on the third episode of Saturday Night Live's second season, which aired on October 2, 1976. Cocker also performed the song with Huey Lewis on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, which aired on 19 July 2012.
