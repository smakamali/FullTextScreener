Lost is an American serial drama television series created by J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof for ABC. Abrams directed the pilot episode, which was based upon an original script titled Nowhere written by Jeffrey Lieber. Six seasons of the show aired, in addition to numerous clip shows to recap previous episodes.
The series follows the experiences of the survivors of a plane crash on a passenger jet, Oceanic Flight 815, which crashed on a tropical island in the South Pacific, with each episode typically featuring action on the island as well as a secondary storyline from another point in a character's life. The series also includes stories of the lives of people already living on the island — they include the "Others", who initially antagonize the survivors, as well as a group of people who arrive on the freighter Kahana. Lost: Missing Pieces consists of thirteen original two- to three-minute clips referred to as "mobisodes" which were produced for cell phones and released between seasons three and four. Multiple former and recurring cast members made an appearance in the series finale.
During the course of the series, 121 episodes of Lost aired over six seasons, between September 22, 2004, and May 23, 2010.

Season four began airing on January 31, 2008, and concluded on May 29, 2008. Production began in August 2007 and was prematurely stopped in November 2007 due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The original plan was to air all sixteen episodes in one consecutive block, uninterrupted by repeats. After the strike was resolved, it was decided that the remaining story for the season would be condensed into what co-creator Damon Lindelof called a "lean, mean five". This would include a three-hour finale, after Lindelof and Carlton Cuse petitioned ABC. Due to the time lost to the strike there was a mini-hiatus after the eighth episode had aired. The series resumed with its post-strike episodes on April 24, 2008.

Season five follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island, where the remaining survivors begin to erratically jump forward and backward through time, following the island being moved in both space and time by Ben, and focuses on the events that lead up to Locke stopping the time jumps and leaving the Island. The second takes place off the island following Locke's death and deals with Jack and Ben's attempt to reunite the Oceanic Six and return to the island with Locke's dead body. The second part of the season starts after the time jumps end and the Oceanic Six return to the island on Ajira Airways Flight 316. The show continues to follow two time lines, both of which take place on the island. The first takes place in 1977 when the survivors who had been left behind are stranded after jumping around in time.
