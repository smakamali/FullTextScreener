== District Realignment ==
Beginning with the 2008–2009 school year, Alvin Independent School District was realigned the following way: Sister schools (Alvin Primary School/Alvin Elementary School; Stevenson Primary School/Walt Disney Elementary School; and Mark Twain Primary School/Longfellow Elementary School) became grades PK-2 and 3–5. All other elementary schools were changed to grades PK-5 with 6th grade being transitioned to the Junior High level across the district. The two alternative schools were not affected by this realignment.
In November 2010, a School Boundary Advisory Committee began work on a new plan to realign the school zones to better balance the student populations and accommodate a new elementary school opening in August 2011 and a new junior high opening in 2012.
