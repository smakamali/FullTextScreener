Fiona is a feminine given name of Gaelic origins. It means white or fair, while the Irish name Fíona means 'of wine', being the genitive of fíon 'wine'. It was coined by Scottish writer James Macpherson. Initially, the name was confined to Scotland but later it gained popularity in other countries, such as Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Australia, Germany and Canada.


== Etymology ==
Fiona originates from the Gaelic word fionn, meaning white or fair, being a Romantic Era Latinised form; or an Anglicisation of the Irish name Fíona (Scotland Fìona) meaning 'of wine', being the genitive of fíon (Scotland fìon) 'wine', from which is also derived the terms (Irish) fíniúin, (Irish, Scottish) crann fíona (crann 'tree'), and (Scottish) craobhfhìona (craobh 'tree, bush') 'grape-vine'. An alternative suggested by Hanks (2006)  is that Fíona means vine; this meaning appears in no Irish or Gaelic dictionary, except in the compounds crann fíona and craobhfhíona In ninth-century Welsh and Breton language Fion (today: ffion) referred to the foxglove species and is also a female given name as in Ffion Hague.
It was used by the Scottish writer William Sharp under the pseudonym Fiona Macleod. Sharp may have drawn inspiration from the Gaelic variation of the name Catherine, namely Caitrìona. Fiona carries connotations of gentility and refinement, often suggesting aristocratic lineage for its bearer. Fiona is commonly shortened to Fi, with other variations including Fina, Fee, and Tiona.
Variations of the name Fiona include Gwenn in Breton, Gwen, and Wynne in Welsh. Masculine forms include Fion, Fionn, Finnán, Finnén, Finn, Gwyn and Wyn. The Scottish Gaelic feminine name Fionnghal is also sometimes equated with Fiona.
