St. Elizabeth or Saint Elizabeth is a village in Miller County, Missouri, United States. The population was 418 at the 2020 census, up from 336 in 2010.


== History ==
St. Elizabeth was originally called "Charlestown", and under the latter name was platted in 1875, after Charley Holtschneider, the original owner of the town site. A post office called St. Elizabeth has been in operation since 1877. The present name is derived from a local Roman Catholic church of the same name, which in turn most likely was named after Elizabeth of Hungary.
The Boeckman Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
