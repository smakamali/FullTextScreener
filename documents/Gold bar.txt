A gold bar, also known as gold bullion or a gold ingot, is a quantity of refined metallic gold that can be shaped in various forms, produced under standardized conditions of manufacture, labeling, and record-keeping. Larger varieties of gold bars, produced by casting molten metal into molds, are called ingots. Smaller bars are often created through minting or stamping from rolled gold sheets. Central banks typically hold the standard 400-troy-ounce (438.9-ounce; 27.4-pound; 12.4-kilogram) Good Delivery gold bar in their gold reserves and it is widely traded among bullion dealers. Additionally, the kilobar, weighing 1,000 grams (32.15 troy ounces), and the 100-troy-ounce (109.7-ounce; 6.9-pound; 3.1-kilogram) gold bar are popular for trading and investment due to their more manageable size and weight. These bars carry a minimal premium over the spot price of gold, facilitating small transfers between banks and traders. While most kilobars have a flat appearance, a preference for brick-shaped bars exists among some investors, particularly in Europe.


== Types ==

Gold bars are classified based on their production process into cast or minted forms, each differing in their appearance and market value.[1] Cast bars, similar to ingots, are formed by pouring molten gold into a mold shaped like a bar, then allowing it to cool and solidify. This method often results in bars with irregular shapes and uneven surfaces, granting each bar a unique identity and making them easily recognizable. Due to their relatively simple production process and minimal handling, cast bars are generally less expensive than their minted counterparts.
Minted bars are made from gold blanks, which are precisely cut from a flat gold sheet to achieve the desired dimensions. These bars are characterized by their smooth and uniform surfaces, reflecting a more refined and labor-intensive manufacturing process.


== Security features ==
Manufacturers have developed measures to ensure the authenticity of gold bars and to protect them against counterfeiting or theft. The most prevalent method involves marking bars with unique registered serial numbers or issuing a certificate of authenticity. Some refineries emboss even the smallest bars with serial numbers, which should correspond with the numbers on their associated certificates.

In contrast to cast bars, which may be handled directly, minted bars are typically enclosed in protective packaging or equipped with tamper-evident technology to deter tampering and prevent damage. Additionally, a security feature known as a Kinegram, a type of hologram, can be embossed directly onto a gold bar. Bars containing this feature are referred to as Kinebars.
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Standard bar weight units ==

Gold is measured in troy ounces, often simply referred to as ounces when the reference to gold is evident. One troy ounce is equivalent to 31.1034768 grams. The troy ounce is heavier than the avoirdupois ounce, a commonly used unit for measuring weight in the United States customary system.
The standard gold bar held and traded internationally by central banks and bullion dealers is the Good Delivery bar with a 400 ozt (12.4 kg; 27.4 lb) nominal weight. However, its precise gold content is permitted to vary between 350 ozt (10.9 kg; 24.0 lb) and 430 ozt (13.4 kg; 29.5 lb). The minimum purity required is 995 â€° gold. These bars must be stored in recognized and secure gold bullion vaults to maintain their quality status of Good Delivery. The recorded provenance of this bar assures integrity and maximum resale value.

One tonne = 1,000 kilograms = 32,150.746 troy ounces.
One kilogram = 1,000 grams = 32.15074656 troy ounces.
One tola = 11.6638038 grams = 0.375 troy ounces.
One tael = 50 grams.
