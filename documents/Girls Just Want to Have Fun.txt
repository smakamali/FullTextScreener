"Girls Just Want to Have Fun" is a single made famous in 1983–1984 by the American singer-songwriter Cyndi Lauper, written by Robert Hazard in 1979, with some of the lyrics changed by Lauper. It was released by Portrait Records as Lauper's debut single from her first solo album, She's So Unusual (1983). Lauper's version gained recognition as a feminist anthem and was promoted by an MTV Video Music Award–winning music video directed by Edd Griles. It has been covered by more than 30 other artists.
The single was Lauper's breakthrough hit, reaching No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and becoming a worldwide hit throughout late 1983 and early 1984. It is considered one of Lauper's signature songs and was a popular song during the 1980s.
The lists "Rolling Stone and MTV: '100 Greatest Pop Songs': 1–50", "Rolling Stone: The 100 Top Music Videos" and "VH1: 100 Greatest Videos" ranked the song at No. 22, No. 39 and No. 45, respectively. The song received Grammy nominations for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards.
Lauper released a new version, "Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)", as the first single from her 1994 compilation album Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some. It reached the top 10 in several countries. In 2013, "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" was remixed by Yolanda Be Cool for the 30th-anniversary reissue of She's So Unusual.


== Background ==
The song was written in 1979 by rock musician Robert Hazard, who performed it with various bands in the Philadelphia area, and enjoyed some local college radio airplay with a demo recording he made. Hazard wrote it as a rock song coming from the male perspective. Hazard's friend, producer Rick Chertoff, brought it to Cyndi Lauper to record as a pop-electronic song. Lauper "flipped the script" and made it carry a feminist attitude by subtly changing some of the lyrics at the suggestion of Chertoff, and she had her own suggestions about how her version should sound. For the recording sessions, Chertoff brought in two longtime musician friends from the Hooters: keyboardist Rob Hyman and guitarist Eric Bazilian. Lauper later said that the Hooters were "my band before I had a band." The song appeared on Lauper's 1983 debut record She's So Unusual.
The track is a synthesizer-backed anthem, from a feminist perspective, conveying the point that all women really want is to have the same experiences that men can have. Gillian G. Gaar, author of She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock & Roll (2002), described the single and corresponding video as a "strong feminist statement", an "anthem of female solidarity" and a "playful romp celebrating female camaraderie." The song is in the key of F# major.
The song's success overshadowed Hazard's own music career. His 1984 album Wing of Fire was a sales disappointment at the same time that Lauper's version of "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" was going Gold, making him a millionaire. After Lauper claimed in interviews to have co-written the song, Hazard served her with a cease and desist letter. He was able to buy a New Jersey lake house and a horse farm from the song's royalties, although he said that federal taxes took most of the money.

Cash Box said that "Robert Hazard's original male point of view is transformed into a cheerleader-like sing-along for party girls, and the Toni Basil–like beat is augmented by a hooky, ringing guitar."


== Chart performance ==
The song was released in late 1983, but much of its success on the charts came during the first half of 1984. The single reached the Top 10 in more than 25 countries and reached No. 1 in ten of those countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway and on the Irish Singles Chart. It also reached No. 2 on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100.
In the United States, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 80 on December 17, 1983. It ultimately peaked at No. 2 on March 10, 1984, where it stayed for two weeks, behind Van Halen's "Jump". In the United Kingdom, the song entered the chart at No. 50 on January 14, 1984, and peaked at No. 2 on February 4, 1984, where it stayed for one week. In Ireland, the song entered the chart on January 29, 1984. It peaked at No. 1 for two weeks and was on the chart for a total of seven weeks. In Australia, the song debuted on the Kent Music Report Top 100 on February 27, 1984. It entered the Top 10 in only its third week on the chart and reached No. 1 on March 26, 1984. It topped the chart for two weeks and then remained at No. 2 for four weeks behind Nena's "99 Luftballons". It stayed on the chart for 21 weeks and was the 9th biggest-selling single of the year. In Belgium, the song debut at No. 38 on February 18, 1984, and peaked at No. 4 on April 7, 1984.

== Music video ==

The release of the single was accompanied by a quirky music video. It cost less than US$35,000 (equivalent to $110,000 in 2024), largely due to a volunteer cast and the free loan of the most sophisticated video equipment available at the time. The cast included Lauper's close friend, professional wrestler/manager "Captain" Lou Albano in the role of Lauper's father while her real mother, Catrine, played herself. Lauper later appeared in World Wrestling Federation storylines opposite Albano and guest-starred on The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! episode "Robo Koopa/Captain Lou is Missing", in which Albano portrayed Mario (Albano also played himself in the episode). This collaboration was the catalyst for the "Rock 'n' Wrestling" connection that lasted for the following two years. Lauper's attorney, Elliot Hoffman, appeared as her uptight dancing partner. Also in the cast were Lauper's manager, David Wolf, her brother, Butch Lauper, fellow musician Steve Forbert, and a bevy of secretaries borrowed from Portrait/CBS, Lauper's record label. A clip of the 1923 film The Hunchback of Notre Dame is featured as Lauper watches it on television.
Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels, another of Hoffman's clients, agreed to give Lauper free run of his brand new million-dollar digital editing equipment, with which she and her producer created several first-time-ever computer-generated images of Lauper dancing with her buttoned-up lawyer Hoffman, leading the entire cast in a snake-dance through New York streets and ending up in Lauper's bedroom in her home. The bedroom scene is an homage to the famous stateroom scene in the Marx Brothers' film A Night at the Opera (1935).
"The year 1983 makes a watershed in the history of female-address video. It is the year that certain issues and representations began to gain saliency and the textual strategies of female address began to coalesce." In the video, Lauper wanted to show in a more fun and light-hearted manner that girls want the same equality and recognition boys had in society.
Before the song starts, the beginning of her version of "He's So Unusual" plays.
The music video was directed by Edd Griles. The producer was Ken Walz while the cinematographer was Francis Kenny. The treatment for the video was co-written by Griles, Walz, and Lauper. The video was shot in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in summer 1983 and premiered on television in December 1983. The choreography was by a New York dance and music troupe called XXY featuring Mary Ellen Strom, Cyndi Lee and Pierce Turner.
The music video crossed one billion views on YouTube in January 2022.

== "Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)" ==

On September 5, 1994, Lauper released a new version, "Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)" by Epic Records, as the first single of her first compilation album, Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some (1994). It incorporates a reggae feel and an interpolation of "Come and Get Your Love" by Redbone from 1974. The arrangement evolved as she experimented with the song's style over the course of the 1993–1994 Hat Full of Stars Tour.
The single reached the top 10 in several countries. It reached number 4 in the UK, becoming Lauper's first top-10 hit there since 1989 with "I Drove All Night". It reached number 4 in New Zealand. In the US, it reached number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100 following its August 8, 1995, release to contemporary hit radio; it is Lauper's last single to chart in the United States. She directed a new music video for the song by herself.


=== Critical reception ===
Steve Baltin from Cash Box noted that the "reggae-flavored dance oriented remake" is being given a big boost from the film To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar. He added, "Lauper still sounds in fine form on the very easy going kick-back track. Particularly fun is the jammin' guitar solo bridge in the middle of the single." In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton said, "The new version slows the track down to turn it into a far slinkier dance groove to quite inspired effect". Alan Jones from Music Week wrote, "Turning a familiar old favourite into a dance groove unusually required a drop in tempo here, reducing it to a slinky shuffle. The melody and Cyndi's excellent vocals are still its selling points, and the success of Cyndi's Twelve Deadly Cyns album suggests the timing could be right to make this a hit again." Tommy Udo of NME considered it a "totally unnecessary reworking" and commented, "It just sounds like somebody's hamfisted and amateurish remix that would normally be hidden away as track 18 – you know, the Will This Do? Mix by DJ Krap – although oddly enough, Cyndi herself had a hand in it all." He concluded, "She could still be bigger than Madonna!"


=== Music video ===
A music video was produced to promote the new version, directed by Cyndi Lauper herself and later made available on YouTube in 2010. It had generated more than 4.7 million views as of April 2025.
