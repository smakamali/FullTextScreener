Hamburger Helper is a packaged food product manufactured by Eagle Foods. As boxed, it consists of a dried carbohydrate (often pasta or rice), with powdered seasonings contained in a packet. The consumer is meant to combine the contents of the box with browned ground beef ("hamburger"), water, milk, and sometimes mayonnaise to create a complete one-dish meal. 
There are also variations of the product designed for other meats, such as "Tuna Helper" and "Chicken Helper". Some of these feature other starches, such as potatoes.


== History ==
The packaged pasta brand "Hamburger Helper" was introduced by General Mills in 1971 in response to a meat shortage and rising meat prices. In 2005, Food Network rated it third on its list of "Top Five Fad Foods of 1970". In 2013, the company shortened the brand's name to just "Helper".
The Hamburger Helper mascot is "the Helping Hand" or "Lefty"â€”a four-fingered, left-hand white glove with a face on the palm and a red spherical nose. It often appears in the product's television commercials and on packages.
In May 2022, General Mills announced an agreement to sell the brand to Eagle Foods for approximately $610 million. On July 5, 2022 the sale was completed.

Tuna Helper became successful as the second variety to appear on the market, in 1972.

Chicken Helper was introduced in 1984 in response to the wide availability of inexpensive boneless and skinless chicken breasts.

Chicken Helper flavors were added in 2007 despite the brand being discontinued shortly thereafter. It returned in 2024, as Hamburger Helper Microwavable. The 2024 re-release is made with dehydrated beef and comes in 4 flavors: Beef Pasta, Cheeseburger Macaroni, Chili Macaroni and Tomato Basil Macaroni.


== In popular culture ==
A 1977 book collecting material from the satirical TV show Saturday Night Live contained an unproduced sketch called "Placenta Helper," an ad for a product which "lets you stretch your placenta into a tasty casserole." The sketch was written by Tom Davis and future United States Senator Al Franken.
In 1979, Scott Spiegel wrote, produced and directed a short film entitled Attack of the Helping Hand, which featured a "Hamburger Helper" oven mitt as a killer glove.
The animated television series Family Guy featured Lefty the mascot in one of their famous "cutaway gags" from the 2009 episode "Business Guy".

On April 1, 2016, General Mills commissioned an EP as an April Fools' Day prank, titled Watch the Stove. According to a press release, the EP was produced for General Mills by a team at St. Paul, Minnesota's McNally Smith College of Music. The EP's title is a parody of the Jay-Z and Kanye West collaborative album Watch the Throne. It contains five songs, all of which are about Hamburger Helper. It instantly achieved a viral status, played over four million times on SoundCloud in less than three days, with many listeners finding value in the brand's promotion of younger artists.
