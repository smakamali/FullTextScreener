== Content ==
"A Little More Country Than That" is a mid-tempo song featuring accompaniment from acoustic guitar and electric guitar, with fiddle and steel guitar fills. In it, the male narrator lists off various rural themes (such as "catching channel cat") each time saying that he is "a little more country than that."
Rory Lee Feek, one-half of the duo Joey + Rory, wrote the song with Don Poythress and Wynn Varble while the three were at a writing retreat held at Mickey Newbury's cabin near Nashville, Tennessee. Poythress began playing a tune on the guitar when Feek suggested the song title "A Little More Country Than That." The song was originally intended to be recorded by Blaine Larsen, but it sat unrecorded for several years before producer Carson Chamberlain heard it and recommended it for Corbin.

The music video for the song was directed by Stephen Shepherd and premiered on September 17, 2009. It depicts Corbin singing and playing guitar in rural areas, as well as scenes of him singing in front of a bonfire at a party.


== Critical reception ==
Karlie Justus of Engine 145 gave the song a positive review, comparing Corbin's vocals to those of George Strait and saying that the song had "organic phrases" and a traditionally country sound. Matt Bjorke of Roughstock also gave the song a favorable review, saying that it was "refreshing" to hear Corbin's neotraditionalist country influences. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was somewhat negative, referring to the song as "a slightly more purposeful variation on an interminable series of rote lists of rural-ish points of reference that Nashville's unambitious go-to songwriters have been attempting to pass off as songs for the past few years."

"A Little More Country Than That" debuted at No. 56 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the chart week ending August 22, 2009. It also debuted at No. 100 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week ending January 23, 2010.
