The cubic foot (symbol ft3 or cu ft) is an imperial and US customary (non-metric) unit of volume, used in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of one foot (0.3048 m) in length, or exactly 28.316846592 L, which is very close to ⁠1/35⁠ of a cubic metre).

== Symbols and abbreviations ==
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot is ft3. The following abbreviations are used: cubic feet, cubic foot, cubic ft, cu feet, cu foot, cu ft, cu.ft, cuft, cb ft, cb.ft, cbft, cbf, feet3, foot3, ft3, feet/-3, foot/-3, ft/-3.
Larger multiples are in common usage in commerce and industry in the United States:

CCF or HCF: Centum (Latin hundred) cubic feet; i.e., 100 cu ft (2.8 m3)
Used in the billing of natural gas and water delivered to households.
MCF: Mille (Latin thousand) cubic feet; i.e., 1,000 cu ft (28.3 m3)
MMCF: Mille mille (= million) cubic feet; i.e., 1,000,000 cu ft (28,320 m3)
MMCFD: MMCF per day; i.e., 1000000 ft3/d
Used in the oil and gas industry.
BCF or TMC: Billion or thousand million cubic feet; i.e., 1,000,000,000 cu ft (28,320,000 m3)
TMC is usually used for referring to storage capacity and actual storage volume of storage dams.
TCF: Trillion cubic feet; i.e., 1000000000000 ft3
Used in the oil and gas industry.


== Cubic foot per second and related flow rates ==
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot per second is ft3/s. The following other abbreviations are also sometimes used:

ft3/sec
cu ft/s
cfs or CFS
cusec
second-feet
The flow or discharge of rivers, i.e., the volume of water passing a location per unit of time, is commonly expressed in units of cubic feet per second or cubic metres per second.
Cusec is a unit of flow rate, used mostly in the United States in the context of water flow, particularly of rivers and canals.
Conversions: 1 ft3s−1 = 0.0283168 m3/s = 28.3168 L/s  = 1.699011 m3/min = 1,699.011 L/min


=== Cubic foot per minute ===
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot per minute is ft3/min. The following abbreviations are used:

cu ft/min
cufm
cfm or CFM
cfpm or CFPM
Cubic feet per minute is used to measure the amount of air that is being delivered, and is a common metric used for carburetors, pneumatic tools, and air-compressor systems.


== Standard cubic foot ==

A standard cubic foot (abbreviated scf) is a measure of quantity of gas, sometimes defined in terms of standard temperature and pressure as a cubic foot of volume at 60 °F (16 °C; 289 K) and 14.7 pounds per square inch (1.01 bar; 101 kPa) of pressure.
