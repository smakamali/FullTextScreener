"6 Foot 7 Foot" (also styled as "6'7"") is a song by rapper Lil Wayne featuring label mate Cory Gunz. It is taken from Wayne's ninth album, Tha Carter IV (2011). It was officially  released on iTunes on December 16, 2010. It was produced by "A Milli" producer Bangladesh. The song samples "Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)" by Harry Belafonte (particularly, as the title implies, the lyric "6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot bunch".)


== Background ==
"6 Foot 7 Foot" is the first single off Tha Carter IV. The track is the first single Lil Wayne recorded following his release from prison on November 4, 2010, though it is the second song on which he has appeared since his prison release, after the final version of Birdman's single "Fire Flame", on which he had 2 verses. In the original version of the single, Lil Wayne is absent due to his prison sentence. Before the song was officially released, Shade 45's DJ Drama interviewed Lil Wayne and he talked about the single. He said "It's a monster," and "Hopefully, it shows people where I'm at lyrically." Mack Maine, president of Young Money and fellow labelmate, called it "A Milli on steroids." The track was originally intended for rapper T.I., but the Atlantic Records manager who also co-managed Lil Wayne decided Lil Wayne would be a better fit. Lil Wayne and producer Bangladesh reunited for the first time since "A Milli" after the royalty dispute between Bangladesh and Cash Money on that song.
It is the second time the trio (Lil Wayne, Cory Gunz, Bangladesh) have worked together, after 2008's "A Milli" (though Cory Gunz was not on the final version of that song). Lil Wayne performed the song on Saturday Night Live and New Year's Eve with Carson Daly. He also performed it on 106 & Party Cash Money Young Money New Years.


== Music video ==
On January 20, 2011, Lil Wayne announced that there would be a music video for the single in the upcoming spring.  A picture was uploaded by Rap-Up of Lil Wayne portraying a boxer. Birdman as well as the Young Money crew (excluding Drake, Nicki Minaj, Tyga, Gudda Gudda and Mack Maine) make cameo appearances in the video. The video made premieres on MTV on March 3, 2011, and on BET's 106 & Park on March 4, 2011. The video (directed by Hype Williams) was inspired by the film Inception, with Lil Wayne and the Young Money crew portraying several scenarios from the film and consists of numerous scenes which visualize many of the metaphors and similes Wayne says in the song. The explicit version of the video has received 195 million views as of March 2024 on YouTube, while the clean version of the video has received above 3.5 million views.
